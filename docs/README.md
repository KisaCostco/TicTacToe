# Tic Tac Toe by Kisa Fór í Costco
Tic Tac Toe is a web console game, just like the original the rules are that each player takes a turn, the first player puts an 'x' in the 3x3 board and then the second player takes a turn and puts an 'o'. This goes on until either one of the player has put his mark in three slots horizontal, vertical or diagonal in a row or when the board is full, which would be a draw. To play the game the player presses a button and his mark appers on the same place in the grid.

## Features

* A win can accure when three of the same marks are in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
* A descriptive error message will appear when a user inputs wrong values for the board.
* A message appears at the end of the came to tell the user or users who has won or if a draw has accured.
* At the start of each players round a message appears that tells the user or users who's turn it is.
* The board gets updated and displayed after each turn.
